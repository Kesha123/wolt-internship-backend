    docker run -d --rm -p 8080:8080 --name delivery-fee-calculator delivery-fee-calculator
    ```
    - [ ] Or run **development** container. Dont forget to change `/path/to/wolt-internship-backend/` to your actual path
    ```
    docker run -d --rm -p 8080:8080 --name delivery-fee-calculator -v "/path/to/wolt-internship-backend/src:/app/src" delivery-fee-calculator
